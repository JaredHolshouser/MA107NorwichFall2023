        <p>Find all the solutions to <m>{{equation}}</m></p>
        <p>Then solve <m>{{inequality}}</m>. Write your answer in interval notation.</p>
        <p>Finally, <m>{{trivial}}</m> either has no solution or is true for all real numbers. Which one is it and why?</p>

        <p>The solutions to the equation are <m>x = {{answer1}}, {{answer2}}</m></p>
        <p>The solution set to the inequality is <m>{{interval}}</m></p>
        <p>{{trivial_answer}} because the absolute value is always positive.</p>
