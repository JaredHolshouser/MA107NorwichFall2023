        <p>Sketch the graph of the line passing through <m>{{point1}}</m> and <m>{{point2}}</m>. Compute the slope, the y-intercept, and the x-intercept. Report the slope as a fraction and the intercepts as coordinates.</p>
    </content>
    <outtro>
        <p>The slope is <m>m = {{slope}}</m>, the y-intercept is  at <m>(0,{{y_int}})</m>, and the x-intercept is at <m>({{x_int}},0)</m>.</p>
        <p>The graph is pictured below. The intercepts are in blue and the original points are in red.</p>
