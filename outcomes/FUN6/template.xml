        <p>The graph of <m>g(x)</m> is obtained from the graph of <m>f(x)</m> through the following transformations.</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>First, {{hshift_phrase}}.</p></item>
            <item><p>Second, {{reflection_phrase}}, and</p></item>
            <item><p>{{scale_phrase}}.</p></item>
            <item><p>Finally, {{vshift_phrase}}.</p></item> 
        </list>
        <p>The graph of <m>g(x)</m> is is pictured below.</p>
