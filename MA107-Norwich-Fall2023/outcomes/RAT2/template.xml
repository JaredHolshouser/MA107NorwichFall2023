                <p>A projectile is launched from a platform that is {{y0}} {{units}} off the ground at a speed of {{v0}} {{units}} per second. Its height above the ground is given by the following equation:</p> 
                <p><m>h(t) = {{model}}</m>.</p>
                <p><m>t</m> is measured in seconds and the height, <m>h(t)</m>, is measured in {{units}}. Answer the following questions, rounding your answers to two decimal places.</p>

                <p>A {{material}} hangs between two posts, roughly forming a parabola. The height of the {{material}} off of the ground is given by the following equation:</p> 
                <p><m>h(x) = {{model}}</m>.</p>
                <p><m>x</m> is the distance from the the first post in {{units}} and the height, <m>h(x)</m>, is measured in {{units}}. Answer the following questions, rounding your answers to two decimal places.</p>

                    <item><p>How high is the {{material}} above the ground when it is <m>{{x_in}}</m> away from the first post?</p></item>
                    <item><p>The height of both posts is <m>{{height}}</m> {{units}}. Use the quadratic formula to determine when the {{material}} will be <m>{{height}}</m> {{units}} off the ground again. Because the posts are the same height, this tells you how far apart the posts are.</p></item>

                <p>A rancher is forming an animal enclosure next to a river. They have {{perimeter}} {{units}} of fence they can use to form the enclosure. If they make the enclosure <m>w</m> {{units}} wide, then the area of the enclosure is</p>
