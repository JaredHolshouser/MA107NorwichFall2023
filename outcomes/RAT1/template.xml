        <p>Power functions that are not polynomials look like <m>f(x) = x^p</m>, where <m>p</m> is not a positive whole number. <m>f(x) = x^{-3}</m>, <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, <m>f(x) = x^{\frac{3}{2}}</m>, and <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> are all good examples.</p>
        <p>Any polynomial with more than one non-zero term is not a power function. <m>g(x) = 5x^2 + 3x - 1</m> is a good example.</p>
        <p>Polynomials with one non-zero term are also power functions. <m>h(x) = x^3</m> is a good example.</p>
