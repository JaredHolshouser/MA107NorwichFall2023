            <p>The following graph is only a relation because it fails the vertical line test.</p>

            <p>Sketch the graph of something which is a function but is not 1-1. Explain how you know that it is a function and how you know is 1-1.</p>

        <outtro>
            <p>The following graph is a function because it passes the vertical line test. It is not 1-1 because it fails the horizontal line test.</p>

        <outtro>
            <p>The following graph is a 1-1 function because it passes both the vertical and horizontal line tests.</p>
